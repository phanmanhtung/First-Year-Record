# First-Year-Record
My first project identifying who were qualified for the first year scholarships and ranking them using pandas

Students who were qualified for the scholarships had to pass all the subject in the first try (no retake the final exam OR retake the course) AND they had to have average score above 14 (there are 2 below 14 but i did not want to eliminate them)

Result: 27 out of 191 students were qualified for the scholarship and I ranked 15th
